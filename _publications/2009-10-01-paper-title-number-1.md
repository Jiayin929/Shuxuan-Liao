  Aquatic life criteria (ALC) serve as the scientific foundation for establishing water quality
  standards, and in China, significant strides have been made in the development of freshwater ALC.
  This comprehensive review traces the evolution of China’s WQC, focusing on the methodological
  advancements and challenges in priority pollutants selection, test organism screening, and standardized
  ecotoxicity testing protocols. It also provides a critical evaluation of quality assurance measures,
  data validation techniques, and minimum data requirements essential for ALC assessments. The
  paper highlights China’s technical guidelines for deriving ALC, and reviews the published values for
  typical pollutants, assessing their impact on environmental quality standards. Emerging trends and
  future research avenues are discussed, including the incorporation of molecular toxicology data and
  the development of predictive models for pollutant toxicity. The review concludes by advocating
  for a tiered WQC system that accommodates China’s diverse ecological regions, thereby offering a
  robust scientific basis for enhanced water quality management.
