  The increasing prevalence of zinc pollution in marine ecosystems, primarily from industrial sources, 
  has become a global environmental concern. This study addresses zinc toxicity in Chinese coastal waters, 
  emphasizing the importance of considering environmental factors like salinity and temperature in establishing 
  water quality criteria (WQC). Data collected from various marine regions underwent meticulous analysis, 
  incorporating salinity corrections to derive more precise criteria values. The short-term criteria 
  for the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea were 94.0, 77.6, 84.2, and 118 μg/L under 
  the salinity correction, respectively, and the long-term criteria was 4.10 μg/L. Ecological risk assessments 
  employing diverse methodologies revealed varying levels of risk across sea areas, underscoring the nuanced 
  nature of zinc pollution's impact on marine ecosystems. Greater acute and chronic risk of zinc ions observed 
  in the Yellow Sea region. These findings underscore the imperative need for tailored management strategies to protect local marine life from the 
  environmental threats posed by zinc.
