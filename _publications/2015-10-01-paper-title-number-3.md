  Water quality criteria (WQC) for zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are crucial due to their extensive industrial
  use and potential threats to marine organisms. This study conducted toxicity tests using marine organisms in
  China, revealing LC50 or EC50 values for ZnO NPs ranging from 0.36 to 95.6 mg/L across seven species, among
  which the salinity lake crustacean zooplankton Artemia salina exhibited the highest resistance, while diatom
  Phaeodactylum tricornutum the most sensitive. Additionally, the EC10 or maximum acceptable toxicant concentration (MATC)
  values for ZnO NPs were determined for five species, ranging from 0.03 to 2.82 mg/L; medaka Oryzias melastigma
  demonstrated the highest tolerance, while mysis shrimp Neomysis awatschensis the most sensitive. Based on the species
  sensitivity distribution (SSD) method, the derived short-term and long-term WQC for ZnO NPs were 138 μg/L and 8.37 μg/L,
  respectively. These values were further validated using the sensitive species green algae Chlorella vulgaris, confirming
  effective protection. There is no environmental risk observed in Jiaozhou Bay, Yellow River Estuary, and Laizhou Bay in the
  northern coastal seas of China. This study provides important reference data for the establishment of water quality standards
  for nanoparticles.
