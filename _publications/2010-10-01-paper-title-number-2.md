  The escalating use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) across various sectors for their broad-spectrum antimicrobial
  capabilities, has raised concern over their potential ecotoxicological effects on aquatic life. This study explores
  the impact of AgNPs (50 Î¼g/L) on the marine clam Ruditapes philippinarum, with a particular focus on its gills and
  digestive glands. We adopted an integrated approach that combined in vivo exposure, biochemical assays, and
  transcriptomic analysis to evaluate the toxicity of AgNPs. The results revealed substantial accumulation of AgNPs
  in the gills and digestive glands of R. philippinarum, resulting in oxidative stress and DNA damage, with the gills
  showing more severe oxidative damage. Transcriptomic analysis further highlights an adaptive up-regulation of
  peroxisome-related genes in the gills responding to AgNP-induced oxidative stress. Additionally, there was a
  noteworthy enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in key biological processes, including ion
  binding, NF-kappa B signaling and cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of xenobiotics. These insights
  elucidate the toxicological mechanisms of AgNPs to R. philippinarum, emphasizing the gill as a potential sensitive
  organ for monitoring emerging nanopollutants. Overall, this study significantly advances our understanding of
  the mechanisms driving nanoparticle-induced stress responses in bivalves and lays the groundwork for future
  investigations into preventing and treating such pollutants in aquaculture.
